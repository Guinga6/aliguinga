# Ali Guinga - Professional Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio website. The website serves as a comprehensive showcase of Ali's academic background, technical skills, project experiences, and professional aspirations. It is designed to provide visitors, including potential employers and collaborators, with detailed insights into his journey as an engineering student specializing in Data Science, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence at the National School of Applied Sciences (ENSA) in Tétouan, Morocco.

## Overview

This website serves as the professional portfolio for Ali Guinga, an engineering student at ENSA Tétouan specializing in Data Science, Big Data, and AI. It presents his academic background, technical skills (including Python, R, HTML/CSS, LLMs, and data science frameworks), soft skills, and project work across areas like Web Development, Deep Learning, and Business Intelligence. Key sections include About Me, Education, Skills, Projects (filterable), Certificates, Resume, and Contact. The site aims to provide a comprehensive view of Ali's qualifications and experience for potential employers and collaborators.

## Technology Stack

The portfolio website is built using fundamental web technologies to ensure broad compatibility and performance. The primary technologies employed are:

*   **HTML5:** Provides the structural foundation for the website content.
*   **CSS3:** Used for styling the website, including layout, typography, colors, and responsiveness. Specific styles are organized within the `css/style.css` file.
*   **JavaScript:** Implements interactive features such as the typed text effect on the home page, navigation highlighting, hamburger menu functionality for mobile devices, and project filtering logic. The core JavaScript code resides in `js/script.js`.
*   **Font Awesome:** Integrated for utilizing scalable vector icons throughout the website, enhancing visual appeal and user interface clarity.

The repository also includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/static.yml`), suggesting automated deployment, likely to GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized logically to separate different aspects of the web project:

*   `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions workflow files for CI/CD, specifically `static.yml` for deployment.
*   `css/`: Holds the Cascading Style Sheets (`style.css`) responsible for the website's visual presentation.
*   `files/`: Contains supplementary files, such as the resume document (`Resume_Ali_Guinga.pdf`) referenced on the site.
*   `images/`: Stores all image assets used within the website, such as profile pictures, project thumbnails, and background images.
*   `js/`: Contains the JavaScript file (`script.js`) that powers the site's dynamic behavior and interactivity.
*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the website, containing the primary HTML structure and content for all sections.
